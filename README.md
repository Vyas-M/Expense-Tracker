# Expense Tracker Application

This project helps the users to add their expenses. They can provide details like title, date, and amount and can also select the category for their expenses. 

The application is currently not persistent, so the users cannot save their data for the future. This app is just to demonstrate my understanding of the flutter framework with respect to the front-end side. 

A new application will be created with a support to persist data in the local database.
